# TF2 HUD INSTALLATION FOR LINUX

Before doing anything else, locate your Team Fortress 2 folder. It should be found in ~/.local/share/Steam/SteamApps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf. Here, you should create a folder named custom. This is where our HUD files will be stored.

The next thing to do is to download the HUD you wish to use. Be sure that the HUD you are using is Linux Compatible. Usually, they will come downloaded in a compressed .zip, .rar, .7z or another compression file. You'll then need to extract the file, which is explained here.

Locate the newly extracted folder. Inside, depending on how the HUD has been packaged, you will always find 2 folders named "resource" and "scripts". Some HUDs may come with other folders, such as "materials". Copy the folder that "resource" and "scripts" are located inside (not the resource and scripts folders themselves) and paste it into the tf/custom folder.

Make sure all folders are named in lowercase, as UPPERCASE letters are unsupported by Linux.

Now, load up your game. If done correctly, you'll be greeted by a nice, new HUD!
